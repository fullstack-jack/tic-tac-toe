// 1. Make a gameboard array
// 2. Make player objects
// 3. Make object to control the game flow
// 4. Make it work in the console
// 5. Once it works in the console, make an object for the DOM logic/have a function to render to the webpage 
// Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game 
// and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!
// (Your main goal here is to have as little global code as possible)
